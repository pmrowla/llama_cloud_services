    "# SEC Form 4 Filings: Who is Buying and Who is Selling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Insider transaction reporting via SEC Form 4 plays an important role in market transparency by forcing corporate officers, directors, and large shareholders to disclose their stock trades within two business days of execution. Because Form 4s contain rich, structured informationâ€”transaction dates, security details, number of shares, prices, and the insiderâ€™s relationship to the issuerâ€”systematically extracting and aggregating these filings enables analysts and investors to detect patterns such as confidence buys, opportunistic sales, or hedging activity long before quarterly disclosures arrive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Automating Form 4 extraction addresses challenges of inconsistent XML/TXT layouts, varying footnote structures, and high filing volumes, ensuring that trading signals derived from insider behavior are captured accurately, updated in real time, and integrated seamlessly into quantitative models and trading dashboards. While it is possible to manually extract from the XML data, this can be a time consuming and error prone process. We will show how we can use LlamaExtract to do this automatically without having to parse the XML data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a stock market index that consists of 30 large companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ and is considered a good proxy for the overall US stock market. For this exercise, we will extract the insider transactions for all the companies in the DJIA. Let's first get the list of tickers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average using Wikipedia."
